# Soil Knowledge Graph 

Welcome to the Soil Knowledge Graph repository! We are excited to present our work on constructing a comprehensive knowledge graph for soil-related information. Our knowledge graph (https://naeima.github.io/soil/) is built with the Forest Observatory Ontology (FOO) https://w3id.org/def/foo/, which serves as the foundation for organising and representing soil data. We used YARRRML's Matey (https://rml.io/yarrrml/matey/) to construct the Soil Knowledge Graph.

The Soil Knowledge Graph aims to provide a deep understanding of soil by interconnecting various aspects such as soil properties, composition, classification, and ecological relationships. By leveraging the power of the Forest Observatory Ontology, we ensure that complex relationships are captured, and different sources of soil data can be integrated seamlessly.

Our primary objective is to enhance data interoperability, foster knowledge sharing, and enable advanced analyses in the field of soil science. The Soil Knowledge Graph acts as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders, allowing them to explore and uncover valuable insights about soil health, ecosystem dynamics, and effective land management practices.

We invite you to dive into our repository, contribute to developing the Soil Knowledge Graph, and use it as a powerful tool to expand our understanding of soils and their crucial role in ecological systems. 

# Soil Sensor Data
The data consist of soil characteristics and nutrients for tropical forests in Sabah, Malaysia, both unlogged and logged. Soil properties (ID, Site, LandUse, PlotName, Subplot, Horizon, pH, TotalC, TotalN, TotalP, inorganicP, C-N, Sand, Silt, Clay) extracted from buried ion exchange membranes and soil nutrients (Identifier, Site, LandUse, PlotName, Subplot, NO3N, NH4N, TotalN, Ca, Mg, K, P, Fe, Mn Cu, Zn, B This data is a contribution from the BALI collaboration, which is financed by the UKâ€™s Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). Modelled datasets in this study can be found at (https://github.com/Naeima/Forest-Observatory-Ontology/releases/tag/Soil-Data-v1.0.0).
